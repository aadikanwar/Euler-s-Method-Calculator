# Eulers Method Calculator
Simple calculator created (in Racket) to approximate solutions to any differential equation via Euler's Method. To access the calculator simply download the code fil and then load it into an IDE that supports Racket. Change the differential equation function such that it fits your differential equation, and then calculate via the main (eulers-method) function!
